Instacart business analysis and visualization using python libraries
Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Introduction
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products

Key Questions
The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
  often do they return to Instacart)?

○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

○ Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
  habits?
  
○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?.
  Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  
○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
  profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
  customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
Analysis Criteria
● Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming conventions.

● Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager.

● Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).

● All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

● Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.

● All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes descriptive comments.

● All required data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

● Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking the top and the bottom of the dataframe.

● Whenever a dataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its shape and basic statistics.

● All project data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge flag shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.

● Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis.

● All column names are self-explanatory.

● All identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.

● Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have been checked and addressed.

● Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created.

● All subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a consistent naming convention.

● Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.

● At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.

● Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to customer information.
